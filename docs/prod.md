Does this $$y_{t}$$ work?

If you want to get your work done, don't get organized, do your work. You can be completely unorganized and still be productivity. If it interferes with your ability to work on the right things, then you need to get organized. Otherwise it's just another task that doesn't help you get your stuff done. You are productive by doing things.
