# Creating a website on Github without using Git

You can create a static website using Github. This post shows how to do it without using or even installing Git.

1. Log into Github and create a new repo. 
2. Within your repo, create a file docs/index.html (it will create a new directory once you hit the `/` key). Paste this line at the top of the editor.
    
    ```
    <!DOCTYPE html><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdme@0.3.0"></script><textarea>
    ```
    
    Then add any content you want to render in markdown format. The top line loads a Javascript markdown rendering engine. It'll convert any markdown that follows to html when someone loads the page.
3. Click the Settings tab. Scroll down to the "Github Pages" section. Select "master branch docs/ folder". You'll see a notification "Your site is published at" followed by the address. Click the link to open your website.
