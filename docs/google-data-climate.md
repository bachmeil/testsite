# Google data centers and climate change

[Our data centers now work harder when the sun shines and wind blows](https://blog.google/inside-google/infrastructure/data-centers-work-harder-sun-shines-wind-blows):

> Addressing the challenge of climate change demands a transformation in how the world produces and uses energy. Google has been carbon neutral since 2007, and 2019 marks the third year in a row that we’ve matched our energy usage with 100 percent renewable energy purchases. Now, we’re working toward 24x7 carbon-free energy everywhere we have data centers, which deliver our products to billions of people around the world. To achieve 24x7 carbon-free energy, our data centers need to work more closely with carbon-free energy sources like solar and wind.
